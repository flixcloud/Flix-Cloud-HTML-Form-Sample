## Overview ##

This is for everyone who's asked for a simple HTML for to test Flix Cloud.
It was written before the Flix Cloud PHP client library sample was done.
Maybe someday I'll update it (or perhaps someone out there would like to).
 
As you will see, I'm not a professional programmer. This is just a sample,
and a very quick & dirty one at that. There's minimal little error checking,
input sanitizing, etc. DO NOT put this script on a public web server unless
you know what you're doing & how to protect it.

## Requirements ##

Linux/Mac OS X, Apache 2+, PHP 4+

(I suppose you could run it on Windows but I haven't tested it.)

The demo only supports files written in & out of Amazon S3.

## Installation ##

1. Copy the htdocs folder to the root of a web server.

1. Open includes/config.php in a text editor and fill in the array elements with your values.

1. Browse to the index.php file.
