## Overview ##

This is for everyone who's asked for a simple HTML for to test Flix Cloud.
It was written before our [Flix Cloud PHP client library sample](http://github.com/flixcloud/flix_cloud-php/tree/master) was done.
Maybe someday I'll update it (or perhaps someone out there would like to).
 
As you will see, I'm not a professional programmer. This is just a sample,
and a very quick & dirty one at that. There's minimal little error checking,
input sanitizing, etc. DO NOT put this script on a public web server unless
you know what you're doing & how to protect it.

## Requirements ##

Linux/Mac OS X, Apache 2+, PHP 4+

(I suppose you could run it on Windows but I haven't tested it.)

The demo only supports files written in & out of Amazon S3.

## Installation ##

1. Copy the htdocs folder to the root of a web server.

1. Open includes/config.php in a text editor and fill in the array elements with your values.

1. Browse to the index.php file.
